# hbtools
Collection of small utility methods, tools and projects for use in VFX, mainly Maya.

Not much has been actually done with it or developed further, however it's an excellent example
of how to write a tool for Maya using Qt and the API together with some custom widgets.

# Maya
The used Maya version when writing was 2016/2017.

# Dependencies
hbtools requires the following external dependencies:

- numpy
- scipy
- Qt.py

For Maya on Windows precompiled numpy and scipy distributions can be found here:
